version 1: commit 68f376c9773f612ae3118c55f829254722dc3772
* no proxy role
* proxy + object on controllers. No way to install only proxy
* object on newrole-swift

version 2:
* Change plugin name to 'detach-swift'
* New role is introduced: swift-object
* Not yet swift-proxy role. The controller are used for proxy
* On controllers only swift proxy
* Swift object on dedicated node without proxy
* Rsync problem: on primary-controller the rsyncd.conf file is not update:
  the problem is in the 'compile fragments' in deployment/puppet/rsync/manifests/server.pp
  To solve the problem a script that execute 'compile fragments' at the end of primary-controller
  deployment is added. In this way it forces to update rsyncd.conf file.
  If not the ring file synchronization is not possible for the resource missing.
* This version need a fix in fuel-library:
  On file deployment/puppet/osnailyfacter/modular/swift/swift.pp:
  $swift_nodes = pick(hiera('swift_object_nodes', undef), hiera('swift_nodes', undef), hiera('controllers', undef))
  This because the variable is used when adding the nodes to the ring, but from globals.pp
  all swift nodes are included, not only object nodes. The plugin add to 'swift_object_nodes' section
  only object nodes

version 3:
* Roles name change: swift-object -> standalone-swift-object
* Remove primary swift object role.
* New role is introduced: standalone-swift-proxy.
* standalone-swift-proxy and primary-standalone-swift-proxy are on separated nodes
  and have their virtual ip and their haproxy and corosync configuration
* Need a patch in fuel-library file deployment/puppet/osnailyfacter/modular/swift/keystone.pp:
  $admin_address    = pick(hiera('swift_proxy_management_vip', undef),  hiera('management_vip'))
  and
  $public_address   = $public_ssl_hash['services'] ? {
    true    => pick(hiera('swift_proxy_public_vip', undef), $public_ssl_hash['hostname']),
    default => $public_vip,
  }
* No way to install standalone-swift-proxy on controller and no way to install proxy and object on the same node

version 4:
* Add option that give the possibility to install proxy on separated nodes. If this option is not checked
  the swift proxy is install on controllers as usual. Swift object is always on separate nodes.
